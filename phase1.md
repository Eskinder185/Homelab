#  LegacyLab ‚Äî Phase 1 Report (System Setup & Remote Access)

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Host:** HP 15-bs0xx (2017) | Intel i7 | 12 GB RAM | 480 GB SSD  

---

##  TL;DR
- Installed **Proxmox VE 9** as a bare-metal hypervisor on the HP laptop.  
- Joined the host to my **Tailscale Tailnet** for secure remote connectivity.  
- Verified **remote SSH** access from outside my local network.  
- Installed **Samba (SMB)** for basic private file-sharing within the tailnet.  
- Kept the environment **lightweight and stable**, preserving memory and disk space for future monitoring and security phases.

---

##  What I Did (Step by Step)

### 1. Base Hypervisor Setup
- Booted into **Proxmox VE 9.0**.  
- Confirmed the web GUI (`https://<LAN_IP>:8006`) is reachable.  
- Verified Proxmox core services are active:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl is-active pvedaemon pveproxy pvestatd pve-cluster
 All returned active.

2. Secure Remote Access via Tailscale
Installed and authenticated Tailscale:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y tailscale
sudo tailscale up --ssh
Confirmed the device joined my tailnet:

bash
Copy code
tailscale status
tailscale ip -4
From an external network, connected using SSH:

bash
Copy code
ssh analyst@100.xxx.xxx.xxx
 Successfully logged in ‚Äî no router port forwarding needed.

3. Private File Sharing (Samba)
Installed and configured Samba:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y samba
sudo mkdir -p /secure_share
sudo useradd -M secureuser
sudo smbpasswd -a secureuser
Edited /etc/samba/smb.conf:

ini
Copy code
[SecureShare]
path = /secure_share
valid users = secureuser
read only = no
encrypt passwords = yes
smb encrypt = required
Restarted and tested configuration:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart smbd
testparm -s
Mapped the share from a client:

php-template
Copy code
\\<TAILSCALE_IP>\SecureShare
 Read/write confirmed.

4. Resource Discipline
No containers or VMs yet ‚Äî focus on stability and connectivity.

Left plenty of headroom for future monitoring stacks.

Verified idle load (htop) under 5% CPU and ~2 GB RAM usage.

 Verification Commands
bash
Copy code
# Tailscale connectivity
tailscale status
tailscale ip -4

# SSH service status
systemctl status ssh --no-pager

# Samba health
systemctl status smbd --no-pager
testparm -s
 Expected Results
tailscale status ‚Üí node connected to tailnet.

SSH reachable externally (through Tailscale).

smbd active and configuration validated cleanly.

 Limits / Reality Check
No VLAN segmentation or firewall yet (coming in Phase 3).

No monitoring dashboards yet (coming in Phase 2).

Hardware constraints (2017 i7, 12 GB RAM) ‚Äî keeping it efficient.

 Next (Phase 2 Preview)
Add Prometheus + Node Exporter to monitor CPU, memory, and disk.

Add Loki + Promtail to collect and centralize auth and Samba logs.

Create a Grafana Dashboard to visualize metrics and alerts in real time.
